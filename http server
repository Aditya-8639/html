// what is ECMA script ?\

//   as far i know it is a set of standards laid down by the Ecma that for a complier to make for the javascript this number
// of functinalities  and the functions must be included 
// for javasript 
//  (European Computer Manufacturers Association )


// what is javascript??

// ECMAScript: Defines core language features (variables, loops, classes, functions).
// JavaScript: Implements ECMAScript and adds Web APIs, browser-specific features
//   , event handling, module systems, and other runtime-specific functionalities (like Node.js) to make it useful for web and server-side development.

  // a programming language that will  implement all the ecma standards and also provide the additional feature like web apis so that it can interact with the browser
//Yes, that's correct! JavaScript provides access to Web APIs that allow it to interact with the browser 
// and perform tasks beyond the core ECMAScript language specification. These
// Web APIs are not part of the ECMAScript standard but are provided by the browser (or the runtime environment) to 
// enable JavaScript to interact with the web environment.

// what is nodejs then???
//  so to make it a backend language they take out the v8 engine compiler that take out the js and added aditonally functionallity to create http server ,
// read file etc so that it directly convert it into 0 1  and send to machine language so it will serve the purpose of the js backend language
